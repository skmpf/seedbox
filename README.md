## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skmpf/seedbox
cd seedbox
```

2. Copy the `.env` template

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

3. Fill in the required value in the `.env` file
4. Start the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Use the appropriate ports to access the web interfaces of each services.

## Notes

- The `gluetun` service is configured for WireGuard by default. Adjust settings as needed for your VPN provider.
- Ensure the specified directories for `DOCKERCONFDIR` and `DOCKERSTORAGEDIR` exist on your host machine.
- Why is there both Plex and Jellyfin? Because Plex has a better UI/UX but is limited in the free version and Jellyfin can do hardware transcoding.
- For Readeck, all environment variables are optional and should be commented unless you want to access the service outside your local network. In which case, you will need to provide both `DOCKERHOST` and `DOMAIN`.

This Docker Compose stack provides a comprehensive setup for managing various network and media services efficiently. Adjust configurations as necessary to suit your environment and preferences.
